My name is Chris Snyder and I have been working full-time as a professional Full Stack Developer since November 2017, but am always interested in hearing about other opportunities where my expertise could be utilized.  In August 2017, I graduated from Washington State University magna cum laude with a BBA in Management Information Systems.  Prior to that I completed three degrees (all with honors) at Spokane Community College including an AAS in Software Development, an AA in Business, and an AA in Arts.  I have an excellent aptitude for learning new technical skills and a proven track record of becoming proficient with them in a short amount of time.</p>\n' +

'                        <p class="calibri main-text">I enjoy spending quality time with family and friends.  I greatly enjoy humor and making others laugh and smile.  For fun I like to hike, bike, listen to music, collect vinyl records, play guitar, sing, and write songs.  I also enjoy doing home improvement projects, and working outside during the warmer months, tending to an impressive vegetable garden.  I am a basketball fan and my favorite NBA team is the Portland Trail Blazers.  Even though I attended WSU (Go Cougs!), I am a huge fan of Gonzagaâ€™s basketball team.  When I am not busy with work, family, friends, or enjoying the other hobbies or interests mentioned, I spend a great deal of time expanding & refining my technical skills by learning as much as I can about software, coding, web development &amp; computers.  I truly love and am satisfied by what I do professionally.  In fact, I enjoy it so much that I am regularly working on professional or personal coding projects for hours after putting in a full day of effort at work.</p>\n' +
